Project Title:
Human Activity Recognition with Time Series Data

Project Description:
This project focuses on recognizing human activities using time series data. Two approaches are explored: a deep learning model using a neural network and a traditional machine learning model using a RandomForest classifier.

Dataset Information:
The dataset used for this project is the time series data of human activities, containing information such as timestamp, x-axis, y-axis, z-axis, and activity labels.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
scikit-learn
TensorFlow
Keras
Matplotlib
Seaborn

Installation Instructions:
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the time series data CSV file 
Set up the project environment.

Neural Network Model:
Load and preprocess the time series data.
Train a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras.
Evaluate the model on the testing dataset.
Visualize training and validation accuracy.

RandomForest Classifier Model:
Load and preprocess the time series data.
Train a RandomForest classifier using scikit-learn.
Evaluate the model on the testing dataset.
Visualize the classification report and confusion matrix.

Results and Visualizations:
The project includes results and visualizations for both the neural network model and the RandomForest classifier. Visualizations include accuracy plots, classification reports, precision scores, and confusion matrices.
